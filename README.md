# Sepsis-RL

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that is used to learn optimal sequential decisions in dynamic environments. In the case of septic management, RL can be used to discover treatment strategies for septic patients in ICUs that eventually improve their chances of survival. Unlike fixed protocols, RL continuously incorporates real-time patient information at each decision-making step, which allows it to personalize its treatment recommendations in response to the specific patient's changing condition. In this project, we reimplemented the methodology from the paper “The Artificial Intelligence Clinician Learns Optimal Treatment Strategies for Sepsis in Intensive Care” by Komorowski et al. [3], which applies an offline RL algorithm to patient data
