# Sepsis-RL

## Goal

In this project, I reimplemented the methodology from the paper [“The Artificial Intelligence Clinician Learns Optimal Treatment Strategies for Sepsis in Intensive Care”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0213-5) by Komorowski et al. 

- This work utilized an offline Reinforcement Learning algorithm to discover treatment strategies for septic patients in ICUs that may improve their chances of survival

- The methodology includes discretizing the state and action spaces into finite sets and then applying the Policy Iteration algorithm for learning an optimal value function. Model evaluation is conducted using the Weighted Importance Sampling method.
